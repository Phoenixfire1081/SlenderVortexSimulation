# Simulation of slender vortex filaments

This page has been setup to support the preprint __*On the motion of hairpin filaments in the atmospheric boundary layer*__ which can be found in arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09302.

Please note that this page is currently __under construction__ and the codes will be uploaded over time.

## Velocity profiles

The velocity profiles have been uploaded with the permission of Dr. Cedrick Ansorge for three Ekman flow cases: N, S_1, S_2. Case N corresponds to a neutrally stratified case and cases S_1 and S_2 are the stably stratified cases. Details of the simulation can be found in the preprint, Ansorge and Mellado (2014, 2016) and the PhD thesis of Ansorge (2016). The code used for the simulation can be found here: https://github.com/turbulencia/tlab.

## Slender vortex filament code

* This code computes the motion of slender vortex filaments with two methods: Local induction approximation (LIA) and the M1 Klein-Knio (M1 KK) scheme. Details of both methods can be found in the preprint.
* It is based on the ezvortex code, written in C, by Daniel Margerit. See the original C code and the corresponding publications here: https://github.com/danielmargerit/ezvortex.
